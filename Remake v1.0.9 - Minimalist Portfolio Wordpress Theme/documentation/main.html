<h3>Recommended PHP Configuration Limits</h3>
<p>Many issues that you may run into such as; white screen, demo content fails when importing and other similar issues are all related to low PHP configuration limits. The solution is to increase the PHP limits. You can do this on your own, or contact your web host and ask them to increase those limits to a minimum as follows:</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-6">
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item">
max_execution_time: 180</li>
<li class="list-group-item">memory_limit: 128M</li>
<li class="list-group-item">post_max_size: 32M</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="whats_included">What's included</h2>
<p>When you purchase our theme from ThemeForest, you can download the Remake files via the 'Downloads' tab on your ThemeForest account. When you download Remake, you have 2 options, either download <code class="highlighter-red">All Files & Documentation</code> or the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Installable WordPress File Only</code>. The former includes the theme files and supporting documents, while the latter only includes the theme's installable WordPress file. The latter is recommended when you're only looking to update/install the theme manually. Aside from the digital files you get when you purchase the theme, you also obtain exclusive services that will help you as you use the theme. Below is a full list of everything that is included when you purchase the theme and download all the included files.</p>
<!--edit later-->
<h2 id="theme_support">Theme Support</h2>
<p>All of our items come with 6 months of included support and free lifetime updates for your theme. After the 6 months period, you have the opportunity to extend support coverage up to 6 or 12 months further. If you choose to not extend your support, you will still be able to submit bug reports via email or item comments and still have access to our online documentation knowledge base and video tutorials. Envato clarifies item support here <a href="http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy" target="_blank">http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy</a> We have an open forum system to answer the question. Support is limited to questions regarding the theme’s features or problems with the theme. We are not able to provide support for code customizations or third-party plugins. If you need help with anything other than minor customizations of your theme, we suggest enlisting the help of a developer.</p>

<h2 id="extend_renew">Extending and renewing Support</h2>
<p>On September 1st, 2015, Envato changed their terms and conditions for item support and introduced paid item support for Themeforest and CodeCanyon. When you purchase a theme, you will be granted an inclusive 6 months period of support for that item. When this expires you can choose to extend your item support for a further 6/12 months at a fee. Please continue reading below to learn more about item support, or click to read Envato's <a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/208191263-What-is-Item-Support-" target="_blanl">'What Is Item Support?'</a> article.</p>
<h3>How To Renew or Extend Support</h3>
<p>You are eligible to renew or extend your support subscription if you have less than 6 months support remaining and the author is still supporting the item. The cost of purchasing support can vary according to the different periods of your subscription. For example, extending your support subscription while it's still active costs less than renewing it when it has expired. To learn more about this, please read Envato's <a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/207886473-Extending-and-Renewing-Item-Support" target="_blank">'Extending and Renewing Item Support'</a> article found here.</p>

<h3>What will happen if I do not renew the item support?</h3>

<h2 id="update-theme">Update Theme</h2>
<p>There are three ways to update your theme. Before you update, it is best practice to always check our update notes. Also we strongly recommend you to make a backup of your previous theme folder. See the information below for more.</p>
<p>Before you update, it's best practice to always check our Important Update Information article which is updated for each new version, and to make a full backup of your theme folder, files and entire database. If you update via FTP, it's important that you delete (not replace) the old Remake theme folder, Codeless Builder and Core plugin folders. They need deleted because if you only replace the folders, then old files can be left on the server and can cause issues. When you update via WordPress admin, these folders are automatically deleted.</p>
<h3 id="envato-plugin">Updating theme using Envato Toolkit or Envato Market plugin</h3>
<p>These two plugins are created both by Envato and server the same purpose. They help you take track of the available updates of theme and all the plugins you have purchased from Envato. You can update them by one click. The later one is a follow up of the first plugin and will also replace Envato Toolkit in a near future. So we strongly suggest to install Envato Market plugin.</p>
<strong>Step 1</strong> – Go to Envato Toolkit plugin option panel:</br><br>
<img src="assets/img/envato-toolkit.png" width="100%" data-action="zoom"></br><br>
<strong>Step 2 </strong>– Enter your Envato Username and Secret API key. To generate an API key, select <i>Settings</i> from the Envato account dropdown, then navigate to the API Keys tab. Multiple API keys can be generated so it is recommended to use one per application.
<br>
<strong>Step 3 </strong>– Back in Wordpress, Click 'Save Settings'.
<br>
<strong>Step 4 </strong>– There will appear a new tab 'Themes'. Find Remake theme there and click update. Then wait some seconds.
<br>
<strong>Step 5 </strong>– Last, update the included plugins. You will see a notification message letting you know the plugins that have a new version and need to be updated. Follow the on screen steps.
<br>
<p>To use the <strong>Envato Market plugin</strong>, follow this <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/envato-market-plugin-guide/">tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wp-theme-update">How To Update Remake via Wordpress</h3>
<strong>Step 1</strong> – Deactivate the current Remake theme in the "Appearance > Themes" section by simply activating a different theme. Once you activate a different theme, you can delete the Remake theme. Your data is saved in the database so the content will not be lost!
<br>
<strong>Step 2 </strong>– Retrieve the remake.zip file from your Themeforest downloads. If you downloaded the "Main Files" from Themeforest, then just unzip the archive file you received. Retrieve the "remake" folder inside of it. Zip it, and upload via Wordpress dashboard.
<br>
<strong>Step 3 </strong>– In the "Appearance > Themes" section, click on the "Install Themes" tab at the top and choose to upload the "remake.zip" file.
<br>
<strong>Step 4 </strong>– After the upload is done, activate the theme.

<h3 id="ftp-theme-update">How To Update Remake via FTP</h3>
<strong>Step 1 </strong>– Go to "wp-content > themes" location and backup your "remake" theme folder by saving it to your computer, or you can choose to simply delete it. Your content will not be lost.
<br>
<strong>Step 2 </strong>– Retrieve the newly downloaded "remake.zip" file from your hard-drive and extract the file to get the "remake" theme folder.
<br>
<strong>Step 3 </strong>– Import the new "remake" theme folder into "wp-content > themes" location. Choose to "Replace" the current one if you did not delete it.
<br>
<strong>Step 4 </strong>– Lastly, update the included plugins. Go to your "wp-content/plugins" folder. Find and delete the plugins that came with the theme.

<!--general update information-->
<h2 id="update_info">Important Update Information</h2>
<h3>Always Backup Your Current Setup</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend to make sure that you have a current backup of your web site, including your <code class="highlighter-rouge">wp-content</code> folder, your <code class="highlighter-rouge">wp-config.php</code> file, and your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.htaccess</code> file in your WordPress installation folder, and a copy of your WordPress database. You can use these to revert back to your original site if anything unexpected happens during the update process. If you are not familiar with the backup process and can not do this yourself, there are several plugins available that completely automate that process for you, such as: <a href="http://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-full-feature-list/">UpDraft Plus</a> and <a href="https://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/">WordPress Backup Buddy</a>. If you are using the Revolution Slider and have added custom css, please make a backup of the styles because those will be removed when you update. You can also backup your Remake Theme Options on the Backup tab in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Appearance > Theme Options > Backup</code>.</p>
<h3>Do Not Keep Older Copies of The Theme In WP Theme Folder. </h3>
<p>You should completely remove all previous Remake theme folders before adding the new updated theme folder, or you could end up with WP path issues, etc.</p>
<h3>Do Not Rename The Theme Folder</h3>
<p>If you rename your theme folder when you update, then the path is no longer valid. WordPress stores menus and widget settings and some other settings by folder path. You need to rename your theme folder back to what it was before, and your settings, menus, widgets will be restored. Make a copy of your current theme folder before you upload the new theme.</p>
<h3>Reset Theme Cache, Browser Cache, Server Cache And Plugin Cache.</h3>
<p>It is always recommended to reset all caching systems after an update, including theme cache, your browser, plugin (e.g. W3 Total Cache), and server cache. Visual issues may happen and more often than not, its caused by caches, and they need to be emptied. Each browser allows you to remove cookies, history and other data. If your theme version is not updated after uploading the new files, it is due to a server-side caching system. Some hosting providers have server-side cache systems installed to optimize the speed of content delivery, please clear any server-side cache or ask your host to do it. This is also true for google pagespeed setups or cloudflare setups. View our general cache information that describes the various forms of cache and how to clear them.</p>
<h3>Update Child Theme</h3>
<p>If you have copied template files from parent theme to child theme. Please make sure to revert to parent theme first to confirm if the issue exists there too. If it doesn’t, please update the templates copied to child theme with the parent theme.</p>
<h3>Required & Recommended Plugins Must Be Updated</h3>
<p>When you update the theme, you will see a notification message in your admin telling you the required and recommended plugins need to be updated. Follow the onscreen prompts to install the plugin updates. Our Codeless Builder plugin is the only required plugin and it has to be installed and activated for theme features to work. Make sure you are always using the most recent version of the Codeless Builder plugin (this will not be an issue if you keep theme up to date). It will be installed automatically upon installing or updating your theme. If you dismiss the prompt or do not see it, then you can go to Appearance > Install Plugins page and install the plugin that way. Every time you update the theme, the plugin also will be updated.</p>
<h3>Plugins – License activation is required to receive updates ?</h3>
  <p>For all the included plugins, Visual Composer too, we have purchased a Extended License that let us to bundle the plugins with the theme.
  This means they can be used by any one purchasing our theme as long as they use the version included in theme folder. You don't need to purchase any other license the plugins are included in the theme. But you can not update it on your own terms with this type of license. The rules of the marketplace do not allow us to give the plugin activation code but you can use the existing version without any problem. We update frequently all theme plugins to their latest versions in every theme release or in case when an urgent update is needed. So they are always fully compatible with the current theme version.

  If you want to buy a license by yourself this is allowed. You have to buy a new single license but we thought that this isn't needed because the version included works perfectly.
  You are free to make the choice that best fits your needs.</p>

<h2 id="install-demo">How to install your Demo template</h2>

<h3>Using the Setup Wizard:</h3>

<h2 id="update_sliders">How to update the premium sliders</h2>
<p>When you purchase Remake theme (any other theme) that bundles Revolution Slider and Layer Slider you get to use these Sliders with the theme. However, your purchase of Remake does not give you an individual license for the Revolution Slider and Layer Slider to use or download as you wish. Due to license rules, we can only issue new plugin updates when we issue new theme updates. So anytime Remake is updated, the latest plugin for the Revolution Slider and Layer Slider will be included. This is according to the licensing rules enforced by Envato, and is something out of our control and must abide by. We ensure that the included plugin updates don't have any critical bugs, or conflict with our own update.
</p>
<h3>How to get auto plugin updates</h3>
<p>Due to the license rules, the only way to get automatic plugin updates is to purchase the plugins individually through CodeCanyon. Doing this provides you with a regular license for the plugin and a purchase code that can be used for Automatic Plugin Updates.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="purchase_sliders">Purchase code for sliders</h2>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
The Remake purchase code cannot be used to register the Revolution Slider or Layer Slider
</div>
<p>When purchasing Remake, you'll be provided with a unique Purchase Code that you can use to receive auto-updates, theme support and demo installation. The purchase code you receive can only be used for the Remake theme, not for the included 3rd party plugins. The 3rd party plugins that come with Remake can still be used and used as the plugin advertises, however since they are bundled with the theme they can only be used on your Remake site, and do not come with their own individual purchase code that allows you to receive premium support/features from the individual plugin author. We provide support for the plugins included in our theme.</p>
<p><strong>You can only register the Layer & Revolution Slider plugins if you have purchased them individually from CodeCanyon</strong>. The status of the plugins state that the site is not authorized to receive updates, this is no cause for alarm. Rest assured that these messages can be ignored and that with every new version of Remake we release, we always make sure to include the latest available versions of the plugins that come bundled with the theme.</p>

<h2 id="other_sliders">Other Sliders</h2>

<p>Aside from the amazing Premium Sliders included in theme, Remake also features various other slider types such as Portfolio and Blog Post Slider, Image Carousels, WooCommerce Featured Products Slider, and finally, the WooCommerce Products Slider.

Like ususally happens with other included plugins developed from other authors.

 <h2 id="install-plugin">How to install plugins</h2>
  <h3 id="#">How to update plugins using Envato Toolkit or Envato Market plugin</h3>
<p>These two plugins are created both by Envato and serve for the same purpose. They help you take track of the available updates of theme and all the plugins you have purchased from Envato. You can update them by one click. The later one is a follow up of the first plugin and will also replace Envato Toolkit in a near future. So we strongly suggest to install Envato Market plugin.</p>
<strong>Step 1</strong> – Go to Envato Toolkit plugin option panel:</br><br>
         <img src="assets/img/envato-toolkit.png" width="100%" data-action="zoom">
      <br><br>
<strong>Step 2 </strong>– Enter your Envato Username and Secret API key. To generate an API key, select <i>Settings</i> from the Envato account dropdown, then navigate to the API Keys tab. Multiple API keys can be generated so it is recommended to use one per application.<br>
<strong>Step 3 </strong>– Back in Wordpress, Click 'Save Settings'.<br>
<strong>Step 4 </strong>– There will appear a new tab 'Themes'. Find Remake theme there and click update. Then wait some seconds.<br>
<strong>Step 5 </strong>– Last, update the included plugins. You will see a notification message letting you know the plugins that have a new version and need to be updated. Follow the on screen steps.<br>

<p>To use the <strong>Envato Market plugin</strong>, follow this <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/envato-market-plugin-guide/">tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3 id="common-errors">Common errors</h3>
<ul class="iconlist">
  <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-right"></span> <p>The included premium plugins won't install:
If you get the "Plugin install, not successful. Source file not found" error, than make sure you are installing plugins from the parent theme. In case you are already working on a child theme, just switch back to parent for the time being. Install included plugins and switch back to child theme.   
If the 'Update' button on the included Premium plugins (Revolution Slider and Layer Slider) is grayed out, this is because you have to register your purchase via Token Registration first. Once you’ve registered your purchase successfully, you’ll be able to activate and update these plugins.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-right"></span><p>When i activate the plugins, the site crashes:
This may be due to your server's PHP configuration limits and will require that these configurations limits be increased. For most, these limits can be increased without having to contact your hosting provider. However, in rare cases some hosts can restrict manual intervention and that will require you to contact your hosting provider to increase the limits for you.  Consult your host provider on how to update the PHP configuration limits.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-right"></span><p>HOW DO I UPDATE THE PREMIUM SLIDERS?
Remake does include updates for our premium slider plugins (Revolution Slider and Layer Slider) however, this does not mean that you will receive an individual license for these Premium Sliders. Due to Envato's licensing rules, we can only issue updates for these plugins when we issue a theme update. This also ensures that we fully test the plugin to make sure there are no critical bugs that will conflict with our own update. But you can not update it on your own terms with this type of license.  If you want to buy a license by yourself this is allowed, but we thought that this isn’t needed because the version included works perfectly.  You are free to make the choice that best fits your needs.
